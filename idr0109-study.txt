Study Description	Deep learning has emerged as the technique of choice for identifying hidden patterns in cell imaging data, but is often criticized as ‘black-box’. Here, we demonstrate that a generative neural network captures subtle details of cell appearance, which permit the prediction of the metastatic efficiency of patient-derived melanoma xenografts with known clinical outcomes. To probe the predictor, we used the network to generate “in-silico” cell images that amplified the critical predictive cellular features. These images unveiled pseudopodial extensions and increased light scattering as hallmark properties of metastatic cells. We validated this interpretation using live cells spontaneously transitioning between states indicative of low and high metastatic efficiency. This study illustrates how the application of Artificial Intelligence can support the identification of cellular properties that are predictive of complex phenotypes and integrated cell functions, but are too subtle to be identified in the raw imagery by a human expert.

Protocol Description	Cell cultures were grown on polystyrene tissue culture dishes to confluence at 37°C and 5% CO2. Melanoma cells derived from murine PDX models were gifts from Sean Morrison (UT Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX) and cultured in medium containing the Melanocyte Growth Kit and Dermal Cell Basal Medium from ATCC. Primary melanocytes were obtained from ATCC (PCS-200-013) and grown in medium containing the Melanocyte Growth Kit and Dermal Cell Basal Medium from ATCC. The m116 melanocytes, a gift from J. Shay (UT Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas), were derived from fetal foreskin and were cultured in medium 254 (Fisher). A375 cells were obtained from ATCC (CRL-1619). SK-Mel2 cells were obtained from ATCC (HTB-68). MV3 cells were a gift from Peter Friedl (MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX). MV3 and A375 cells were cultured in DMEM with 10% FBS. WM3670, WM1361, and WM1366 were obtained directly from the Wistar Institute and cultured in the recommended medium (80% MCDB1653, 20%, 2% FBS, CaCl2 and bovine insulin).
